Emphasis & Styling  
------------------ 
- Use ALL CAPS for emphasis (instead of bold or italics) no **emphasis**
-- This will hopefully help prevent people (especially AI) from constant italics and bold text

QUOTES & EXCERPTS  

"This is a quoted section."  

"This quote  
spans multiple lines  
and still works fine."  

- No special syntax—just natural "quotes"  
- Multi-line quotes work the same way  

CODE & COMMANDS  

Inline Code  
This is `inline code` in a sentence.  

Multi-line Code Block  
```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt upgrade -y  
```

- Uses backticks ` like Markdown  
- No need for special new syntax  

SEPARATORS & BREAKS

- No separate section break needed - titles and blank lines provide structure

Dumbdown is simple, readable, and universally usable.
